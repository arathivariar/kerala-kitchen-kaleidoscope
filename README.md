# Introduction  

Kerala Kitchen Kaleidoscope is a website featuring recipes from Kerala. Kerala cuisine is a culinary style originated in Kerala, a state on the southwestern Malabar Coast of India. It offers a multitude of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. Kerala is known as the "Land of Spices" and we use chillies, curry leaves, coconut, mustard seeds, turmeric, tamarind, asafoetida and other spices in the preparation. Having been a major production area of spices for thousands of years, the region makes frequent use of black pepper, cardamom, clove, ginger, and cinnamon.
Kerala Kitchen Kaleidoscope has been developed as part of the Code Institute's Full-Stack Developer course as my fourth project. It is focused on Django and Bootstrap frameworks, database manipulation and CRUD functionality. 
I am born and brought up in Kerala and now living in Germany. I chose this topic for my project as I wanted the world to know about the rich flavours of Kerala cuisine.

# Project Management- Agile Methodologies   

Kerala Kitchen Kaleidoscope is the first project where I followed Agile planning methods by myself. I had participated in Code Institute's March Hackathon and that experience helped me a lot as I already knew how it works. I used my Github Projects Board to plan and document all of my work. This was a huge a learning experience for me even though I have worked with Agile before in my career. 

# MoSCoW Prioritization  

I followed the MoSCoW Prioritization method for Kerala Kitchen Kaleidoscope by identifying and labelling my:

+ Must Haves: the 'required', critical components of the project. Completing my 'Must Haves' helped me to reach the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for this project early, allowing me to develop the project further than originally planned.

+ Should Haves: the components that are valuable to the project but not absolutely 'vital' at the MVP stage. The 'Must Haves' must receive priority over the 'Should Haves'.

+ Could Haves: these are the features that are a 'bonus' to the project, it would be nice to have them in this phase, but only if the most important issues have been completed first and time allows.

+ Won't Haves: the features or components that either no longer fit the project's brief or are of very low priority for this release.
